# FB Pix Downloader

Now that people are starting to flee Facebook, FB Pix Downloader helps you to get all your tagged pics of FB. Because you're not the owner of these pictures, it's a bit laborious to manually download them. This extension automates a lot of the process.

Thanks to [this project](https://github.com/mgjohnston/fmpd/tree/patch-1) for figuring out the hard bit.

Usage:
1. Install the extension. 
2. Make sure you're using the new Facebook design
3. Go to your Facebook profile photos, select the "Photos of You" tab and scroll all the way to the bottom so that all the thumbnails have loaded
4. Click on the FB Pix Downloader extension icon in the top right of the browser window.
5. The pictures will all download into a subfolder of your downloads folder called "Facebook Photos"

Note: the photos are only properly timestamped from 2012 or so, when Facebook started timestamping the image files. I'm too lazy to figure out how to parse the uploaded date from the Facebook HTML for the early photos. But at least they're in order.
